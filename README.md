The following repository contains code authored by the Bernhardt Lab's 2025 Data+/Climate+ team, including Abdulmlik Almuhanna, Uzair Chaudry, Melosa Rao, and Boyu Tan, and uses a supervised machine learning model to identify insect from images of sticky traps (see image) deployed weekly along several streams in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire.

For visualizations of the existing insect record that has so far been manually counted from sticky traps, please visit: [hbwater.org](hbwater.org).
