The following repository contains code authored by the Bernhardt Lab's 2025 Data+/Climate+ team, including Abdulmlik Almuhanna, Uzair Chaudhry, Melosa Rao, and Boyu Tan, and uses a supervised machine learning model to identify insect from images of sticky traps (see image). 

Traps are deployed weekly along several streams in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire during the snow-free season (approximately April through November) and, since 2018, have been counted by hand to identify dominant aquatic taxa (Diptera, Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera). This record is maintained by Mike Vlah, Tamera Wooster, Chris Solomon, and Emily Bernhardt.

For visualizations of the existing insect record that has been manually counted so far, please visit: [hbwater.org](hbwater.org).
